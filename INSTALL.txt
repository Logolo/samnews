	    INSTALL SAMNEWS
========================================
1. Upload contents to web server
2. Import two SQL files in /sql to sql server (into two seperate databases, ie: samnews, samnews_sphider)
3. Change database information (lines 7-10) in /config.php (should point to the database made from samnews.sql)
4. Change SITE_URL (line 17), DEVELOPER_EMAIL (line 30), RSS_KEY (line 33), COOKIE_PREFIX (line 38)
5. Configure SMTP email server information in /includes/email_setup.php - this is necessary for Registration/Forgot Password email notifications
	See http://phpmailer.worxware.com/ for support with PHPMailer
6. Visit the site and log in with the username: admin and the password: password
7. IMPORTANT: After logging in, go to the 'edit user' page under the admin's profile (click on admin next to logout at the top right)
8. Change the password (enter a new one in the blank), email address, and cookie key (to something random/unique) - if you do not change these values the account could be hijacked

========================================
    CONFIGURE SPHIDER SEARCH ENGINE
 by Ando Saabas - http://www.sphider.eu/
========================================
9. Change database information (lines 2-5) in /sphider/settings/database.php (should point to the database made from samnews_sphider.sql)
10. Change Sphider user name and password (lines 3-4) in /sphider/admin/auth.php to something unique
11. Visit /sphider/admin/admin.php in your browser, log in with your Sphider user name and password
12. Under the Sites tab, click 'Add Site'
13. Type the complete URL to your SamNews installation in the URL field
14. Type an alias for your site in the Title field

15. After the site has been added to Sphider, you can 'Re-index' it, and do this manually every so often to keep your search results up to date
	- OR - You can set up a CRON job on your server to execute Sphider's crawler automatically

	The CRON command is - replace the bracketed text with your information:
	php [LOCAL PATH TO YOUR PUBLIC_HTML DIRECTORY]/sphider/admin/spider.php url=[SAME VALUE FOR THE URL FIELD YOU USED WHEN ADDING THE SITE TO SPHIDER] reindex=1 soption=full out=show_faces
	(Note: The out=show_faces prevents Sphider from indexing pages with show_faces - these are the Facebook buttons and without it your search results will be polluted)

========================================
     CONFIGURE RSS FEED GENERATION
========================================
16. Set up three CRON jobs (one for each of the 3 RSS files to be generated) - replace the bracketed text with your information:
	lynx -dump "[SITE URL]/cron/gen_rss.php?mode=index&key=[RSS_KEY FROM CONFIG.PHP]"
	lynx -dump "[SITE URL]/cron/gen_rss.php?mode=new&key=[RSS_KEY FROM CONFIG.PHP]"
	lynx -dump "[SITE URL]/cron/gen_rss.php?mode=alltime&key=[RSS_KEY FROM CONFIG.PHP]"
